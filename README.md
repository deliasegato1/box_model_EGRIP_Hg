The box model is run using the KPP (Kinetic PreProcessor) model publicly available at https://people.cs.vt.edu/asandu/Software/Kpp/.

Instructions using Ubuntu terminal:
1) Install KPP following the documentation instructions
2) Go to KPP directory
```
cd $KPP_HOME
```
3) Clean the KPP installation, delete the KPP object files and all the examples with:
```
make clean
make distclean
```
4) Create the kpp executable with:
```
make
```
5) change directory to where box_model_update is stored
6) Run the model:
```
kpp box.kpp
```
7) Compile and run the Fortran90 code:
```
make -fMakefile_box
```
8) Run the executable file
```
./box.exe
```
